* Work Experience (5 years)
** SigFig
   - typescript
   - angularJS
   - custom webpack configuration
   - custom CLI build tool for legacy frontend app
   - react
   - scala
   - akka-http
   - A/B testing

     My first role at SigFig was as an angularJS dev. Along with developing unit-tested features and
     fixing bugs, I helped redesign the build system of a large whitelabeled typescript app to use
     ES2015 modules and dependencies managed with npm or yarn and converted hundreds of files to the
     new system in the successful migration. I personally refactored the build system to decouple
     its new build tool from its old one and significantly simplify its configuration. I also
     designed the angularJS A/B testing API and rewrote its integration with a 3rd-party testing
     service, using a modular design so that the 3rd-party service could easily be replaced by a
     better alternative down the line. I was also involved in the early stages of work with a new
     frontend application using typescript and react.

     Soon after, I transfered over to help build the Scala backend service which supports that
     product. I helped spec out the REST API, and I wrote code which aggregated and composed data
     from various microservices to simplify complex, paperwork-heavy workflows.

** Legal Information Institute, Cornell University Law School
   - ES2015
   - build scripts
   - browser caching

     Cornell Law School picked up the Lawfetcher project, rebranding it as RIO (Read It Online) and
     hiring me to maintain and expand it. I refactored and completed test coverage of the domain
     logic; wrote code to parse a broader set of citation types and link to more sources; converted
     the build process to transpile modular ES2015 application code and tests; and implemented a
     [[http://guides.rubyonrails.org/asset_pipeline.html#what-is-fingerprinting-and-why-should-i-care-questionmark][filename fingerprinting]] system to manage browser caching, enabling both frequent, iterative
     code deployment and efficient loading.
** The Emoji Foundation
   - php 7
   - Apache
   - build scripts
   - SEO

     As a consultant, I did freelance work for The Emoji Foundation's crowdsourced Emoji Dictionary.
     The work focused on human-readable URLs, rewriting database queries and building indexes for
     clarity and efficiency, and other SEO and performance fundamentals, as well as extracting
     shared templates and refactoring old code for better semantics and maintainability.
** Flock
   - Rails 4
   - Middleman
   - SCSS
   - encryption & authentication

     As software engineer for an HR and compliance startup, I worked with the entire stack from
     stylesheets to server ops. I maintained Middleman static sites for the company's landing page
     and blog as well as its Rails app. I personally implemented secure and user-friendly
     integrations with TraxPayroll and Greenhouse.io, which involved complicated data mapping,
     multiple forms of encryption, and, at times, working with out-of-date and contradictory
     documentation. I organized both the stylesheets and javascript assets, spanning hundreds of
     files (some containing several thousands of lines); and in general, worked hard to model and
     advocate for consistency of data modeling, clear and explicit API boundaries, and well-designed
     abstraction on a codebase, initially built by foreign contractors, that left much to be desired
     in those regards.
** Lawfetcher
   - JavaScript
   - karma & jasmine unit tests
   - browserify
   - regular expressions

     A freelance project in collaboration with Emeritus Prof. Peter W. Martin of Cornell Law. A free
     tool for legal writing, it semantically parses US legal citations and programmatically builds
     direct links to the full text in various free and subscription services. More regular
     expressions than you can shake a stick at.

* Education
** Dev Bootcamp, 2014
   - programming & web fundamentals
   - git & *nix command line
   - Ruby & Rails
   - JavaScript, HTML, & CSS



** Cornell College, class of '08
   B.A. in English, minor in Music.
   Received 2007 Winnifred Van Etten Award for Creative and Scholarly Excellence.

   I chose my subjects through an interest in how human expression is shaped by the logical systems
   it exists within, like syntax, grammar, and tonal harmony. I was trained to evaluate writing for
   organization, style, and clarity. I have found this to be a surprisingly sound foundation for
   programming.
