          I most recently worked as a full-stack developer at Artisan, a pre-series-A
          startup automating sales outreach. I enjoyed the programming, though it proved to
          not be a good fit in other ways. In my time there I wore many hats, working on
          every part of the stack to quickly ship a wide variety of projects to production.
          I designed and built complex new features, including a full rewrite of the lead
          outreach sequence model from a hardcoded three-email sequence to fully custom
          workflows supporting branching logic, and added outreach through external
          services, requiring custom authentication as well as complex scheduling,
          rate-limiting, and error handling logic. I also handled cloud infrastructure
          issues, database modeling and performance optimization, and added features to
          the react UI.

          At Airbyte, I worked on a variety of projects in a primarily frontend
          role. I consistently worked to improve code quality in the company's
          react web app; shipped the UI for a DBT cloud integration on an
          extremely tight schedule; restructured the cypress end-to-end test suite
          and rewrite its build system to allow better code reuse and type safety;
          and expanded the feature set of Airbyte's Connector Builder, including
          both improvements to its complex and dynamic editing UI, and backend
          updates to both its java server endpoints and the python low-code
          connector CDK which parses user-authored connector definitions.

          As a full-stack developer at Indiegogo, I helped rewrite the legacy
          checkout UI from angularJS to vue; implemented a new suite of Cypress
          integration tests, improving speed, cost, reliability, and DX. I
          personally designed and implemented a total rewrite of the advertising
          metric system campaigners rely on after a facebook policy change; this
          required significant code changes, high-volume async job processing, and
          close coordination with nontechnical stakeholders both internal and
          external. I played a key role designing and building a new product to
          help campaigners manage inventory, shipping, and communication. The site
          significantly outperformed the main Indiegogo website while minimizing
          the learning curve for other devs.

          Working primarily as a frontend engineer at a digital wealth management
          startup, I helped redesign the build system of a large whitelabeled
          typescript app to use ES2015 modules and manage dependencies with npm or
          yarn; I converted thousands of files to the new system during the
          migration. I personally refactored the build system to remove its gulp
          dependency, dramatically simplifying configuration work. I also designed
          the frontend A/B testing API and rewrote its integration with a
          3rd-party assignment backend, using a more modular design to decouple
          internal code from the idiosyncracies of that vendor. I helped launch a
          new typescript/react frontend application, including work on its Scala
          REST API.

          alone, I worked over 1000 hours at the San Francisco campus in an

          B.A. in English, minor in Music. Received 2007 Winnifred Van Etten Award

          Though seemingly unrelated, my studies centered on an interest in how
          human expression exists within and is influenced by logically analyzable
          systems like syntax, music theory, or grammar. I have found this to be
          surprisingly good preparation for the work of programming.
