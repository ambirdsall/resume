              file override system powering different whitelabeled builds of the

          B.A. in English, minor in Music. Received 2007 Winnifred Van Etten
          Award for Creative and Scholarly Excellence.
          <br />
          <br />
          Though seemingly unrelated, my studies centered on an interest in how
          human expression exists within and is influenced by logically
          analyzable systems like syntax, music theory, or grammar. I have found
          this to be surprisingly good preparation for the work of programming.
